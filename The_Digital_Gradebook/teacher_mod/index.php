							<h3>What is The Digital Gradebook App?</h3>
							<br>
The Digital Gradebook App implemented by me is a digital grading system, located in an online environment, more explicitly, it is a web application that is accessed through a program that runs in the desktop environment, called browser.
The application in its current state is a prototype of an application that will follow the evaluation of students through several methods. Being a more complex application that seeks evaluation in several forms, the final product will be more than a digital and online grading system, it will be a complex educational platform.
The prototype of the application in its current state, currently has a small method of evaluating students. The foundation of the application is the management of the 3 institutional entities. I have created the environment for 

the entire institution and through this environment we will make possible the implementation of various evaluation methods.
