# The Digital Gradebook

## Overview
The prototype of the application in its current state, currently has a small method of evaluating students. The foundation of the application is the management of the 3 institutional entities. The 3 entities are: admin, teacher, student. I have created the environment for the entire institution and through this environment we will make possible the implementation of various evaluation methods. As the evaluation method the application has a quiz test. the teacher can create a grid test that the student can solve later. The student launches the quiz and at the end of the test the number of correct answers appears. Thus, the teacher can evaluate his student to see what level it is at.
